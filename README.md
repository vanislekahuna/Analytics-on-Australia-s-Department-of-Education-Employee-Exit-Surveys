# Analytics-on-Australia-s-Department-of-Education-Employee-Exit-Surveys
In this project, we aim to answer questions regarding the nature of employee's resigning from Australia's Department of Education, Training, and Employment (DETE). To investigate this issue, we'll be exploring datasets from the DETE as well as data gathered from the Technical and Further Institute (TEFA) in Queensland, Australia to define and answer the following business questions:  Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer? Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?
